            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SIR <hi>JOHN WRAYES</hi> Speech the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>November,</hi> Concerning Epiſcopall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Challenge for Lordly Primacie hath of old been grounded out of the great Charter, by which they hold an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Primacie or Iuriſdiction to belong to their ſtates of Prelacie, this is their Temporall foundation and main obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Here I demand of them, unto what Church this great Charter was granted, and whether it were not granted to the Church of GOD in <hi>England,</hi> let the word
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58183:3"/> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> deſide this, which are their <hi>Conceſsimus pro nobis &amp; in perpetuum quod Eccleſia Anglicana libera ſit habeat omnia, ſua Jura Integra, &amp; libertates ſuas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illaeſus.</hi> Now by this Charter if it be rightly interpreted, there is firſt proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, the honour and worſhip ſhould be yeelded unto God, as truly, and indeed belongs to him.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, That not onely ſuch Rights and Liberties as the King and his Progenitors, but alſo ſuch as God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ſhould be inviolably preſerved. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch onely are to be preſerved, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch onely are to be called the rights and Liberties of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which God himſelf hath given by his Law unto the univerſall Church. And not that which the King of <hi>England</hi> by their Charter have bequeathed to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of <hi>England.</hi> And this no doubt was the cauſe that moved <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth ſo effectually and powerfully to bend himſelf againſt the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58183:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> uſurped at that time over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (for ſaith the King) we will with hazard of our life, and loſſe of our Crown, uphold and defend in our Realms, whatſoever we ſhall know to be the will of God.</p>
            <p>The Church of God in <hi>England</hi> not being free according to the great Charter, but in bondage and ſervitude to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the Law of God, the King iudged it to ſtand highly with his Honor, and with his Oath, to reform, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, and amend the abuſes of the ſame See.</p>
            <p>If therefore it might pleaſe our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraign Lord King CHARLES in imitation of thoſe his Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, to vouchſafe an aboliſhment of all Lordly Supremacie, executed by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopall and Epiſcopall Authority, over the Miniſters of Chriſt: his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſo doing could no more rightly be charged with the violation of the great Charter, then might King <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth with the baniſhment of Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58183:4"/> or then our late Soveraign Queen <hi>Eliz</hi> could be iuſtly burthened with the breach of her Oath, by the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Oath, were ſo ſtraitly tyed to the words of the great Charter, that they might not in any ſort have diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any ſuppoſed Rights or Liberties of the Church then uſed, and confirmed by the ſaid Charter unto the Church that then was ſuppoſed to be the Church of God in <hi>England.</hi> Then belike King <hi>Hen.</hi> the eight might be attainted to have gone againſt the great Charter, and againſt his Oath, when by the overthrow of Abbies and Monaſteries, he took away the Rights and Liberties of Abbots and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, for the expreſſe word of the great Charter, Abbots and Priors, had as large and ample a Pattent for their Rights and Liberties, as our Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops can at this day challenge for their Primacie.</p>
            <p>If then the Rights and Liberties of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58183:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> one as being againſt the Law of God, be duely and lawfully taken away, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any matter, clauſe, or ſentence contained in the great Charter, the other have but little reaſon under the colour of the great Charter to ſtand upon their pantables, and contend for their painted ſheathes: for this is a Rule and Maxime in Gods Laws, <hi>Quod in omni Iuramento ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excipitur authoritas Maioris:</hi> Vnleſſe then they be able to juſtifie by the holy Scriptures to ſuch Rights and Liberties as they pretend for their ſpirituall Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie over the Miniſters of Chriſt, be in deed and truth conferred unto them by the holy Law of God, I ſuppoſe the Kings Highneſſe as Succeſſor to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and as more juſt Inheritor to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by the words of the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by his Oath, are bound utterly to aboliſh all Lordly Primacy as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upheld, and defended, partly by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and partly by unreaſonable and evill Cuſtome.</p>
